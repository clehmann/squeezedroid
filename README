Android program to control a SqueezeBox? from your phone via SqueezeServer?.

Current (semi) implemented features include:

* Choose/switch player to control
* Browse and add music by artist/album/song/genre/new music
* View album art/song info with animated display
* View/remove artis/album/song from playlist
* Sync players
* Search
* Application support
* Folder browsing
* Download support
* Playback control (pause,next,back,shuffle,repeat,volume,seek)

This is still in early development, it can/will break you phone, burn down your house, etc (but probably just won't work in the worst possible case). Patches/bug reports/better graphics/suggestions are much welcomed.

You can install from the android market by searching for 'SqueezeDroid?'
